# Cub3D

Cub3D is a 3D game project built using raycasting technology, inspired by early first-person shooter games like Wolfenstein 3D. The project is part of my journey in learning C, where I developed a deeper understanding of graphics rendering, algorithms, and low-level programming. By working on this project, I significantly enhanced my skills in game development, focusing on graphical programming and engine mechanics.
